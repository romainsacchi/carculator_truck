Installation
============

Python Version
--------------
We recommend using the latest version of Python. ``carculator_truck`` supports a Python 3.x environment.
Because ``carculator_truck`` is still at an early development stage, we recommend installing it in a separate environment.

Using Conda environment
-----------------------

Create a conda environment:

.. code-block:: bash

    conda create -n <name of the environment> python=3.7

Once your environment created, you should activate it:

.. code-block:: bash

    conda activate <name of the environment>

And install the ``carculator_truck`` library in your new environment via Conda:

.. code-block:: bash

    conda install -c romainsacchi carculator_truck

Using Pip
---------

Use the following command to install the ``carculator_truck`` via ``pip``:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install carculator_truck

.. note:: This will install the package and the required dependencies.
